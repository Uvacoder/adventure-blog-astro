# 🏔 Astro Adventure Blog

This is a [Astro](https://astro.build) blog using Notion as a CMS. All blog pages are written in Notion and are rendered to static HTML using [react-notion-x](https://github.com/notionx/react-notion-x).

The only JS that is sent down to the browser is for the theme switcher, which is written in Svelte.
